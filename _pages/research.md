title: Research & Study
---

I'm interested in Human-Machine Communication and Human-Computer Interaction. To specify, I'm curious about two major questions:  

[1] How social cues from interactive technologies (e.g. AI, virtual agents, robots, chatbots, VR, etc.) influence human perception and behavior?  
[2] How humans’ actions toward interactive technologies affect their (subsequent) perception and behavior?  

Interestingly, although I was taught by a university known for its [qualitative research](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/gumg/ourpurpose/), I developed a strong interest in the quantitative approach. Thus, I taught myself programming, quantitative data anaysis, and computational methods, which can be seen in my study notes.
