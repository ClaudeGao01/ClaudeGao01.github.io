I'm interested in Human-Machine Communication and Computational Communication. To specify, I'm curious about three major questions:  
[1]How social cues from interactive technologies (e.g. AI, virtual agents, robots, chatbots, VR, etc.) influence human perception and behavior?  
[2]How humans’ actions toward interactive technologies affect their (subsequent) perception and behavior?  
[3]How novel computational methods (e.g. LLM, big data, computer vision, NLP, etc.) can be applied into communication research.   
Interestingly, although I was taught by a university known for its [qualitative research](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/gumg/ourpurpose/), I developed a strong interest in the quantitative approach. Thus, I taught myself programming, quantitative data anaysis, and computational methods, which can be seen in my study notes.
