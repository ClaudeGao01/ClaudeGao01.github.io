Hello! I'm Zeyu, a passionate lover of Media & Communication. Currently, I serve as a lecturer at Department of Journalism, [Yantai Institute of Technology](https://www.yitsd.edu.cn/). Before that, I earned my MSc from [Glasgow University Media Group (GUMG)](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/gumg/), University of Glasgow and my BA from [Yantai University](https://www.ytu.edu.cn/).

I was fortunate to graduate with distinction with my Master's degree. Also, my undergraduate tuition was fully-funded by scholarships, such as China National Scholarship.

My research interests include Human-Machine Communication and Computational Communication. I enjoy using quantitative methods (experiment, survey, SEM, NLP, big data, etc.). If you have any communication or cooperation intentions, please feel free to contact me via e-mail (gaozeyu01@sina.com).

 
Beyond Research
======
I interned at several tech companies, including internet, big data, telecommunications, etc. I also worked as a TV station director, debater, and student representative during my university years.
